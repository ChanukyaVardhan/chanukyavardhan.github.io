            LLMs are tricky. add anything else from LLM
            It's better to have preference according to group (and even better individual) for various reasons.
            Recent works like gpo tried doing this with few shot methods using LLM. This can be flimpsy, context length less, and is targeted at the use-case when there is low data per group.
            We aim to do better group alignment, and for large data per group.
            Recently, there has been work on aligner which aligns LLM outputs to safer and harmless reposnses. 
            We leverage that aligner and add adapter modules for each group and get a group aligner for each group. This corrects the outputs from LLM for that group.
            This fixes x and y. We wanted to create a model with the ability to train on large data, and be more robust.
            Qualitatively, we saw that our responses are more robust. (TODO: train gpo also if possible on descriptive sentences and aligner with objective answers)

        <h2 class="title is-3">Background</h2>
          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              LLM may disproportionately over-represent some groups and under-represent others. Although guiding an LLM using prompts such as "Speak as xxx" can enhance its performance, this approach is limited and can sometimes lead to misrepresentation.
              <figure>

              </figure>
              
              
              While prior methods including supervised fine-tuning, prompting, and context learning have been useful in many alignment settings, these methods could perform poorly and be computationally expensive for aligning LLM outputs to group preferences, especially in low data regimes.

            <h3 class="title is-4">Datasets</h3>
              <p>We evaluate our method on two datasets.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Survey Dataset - OpinionQA</strong>: OpinionQA<a href="#opinionqa"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is a recent survey dataset designed to facilitate research in opinion-based question answering systems. It comprises a diverse collection of survey questions sourced from real-world data, capturing a wide range of opinions across various demographics. OpinionQA spans 22 US demographic groups (e.g. income, political ideology, race, and sex) across 500 multiple-choice questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Synthetic Dataset - DescriptiveOpinionQA</strong>: Since OpinionQA is constructed based on the survey questions which have options, we looked out for aligning conversations that have better descriptive answers rather than simple options. To achieve this, we construct a synthetic dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate a descriptive version for the same questions available in the OpinionQA dataset. We use prompts similar to those used in steering the LLM in OpinionQA to generate descriptive responses as alternatives to the options provided in the survey question of OpinionQA.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <p>The datasets are processed to get to question-answer-correction (Q-A-C) format following Aligner<a href="#opinionqa"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Q is the question that is directly picked from from OpinionQA. A is the response generated by an LLM. C is the corrected response that the Aligner is supposed to generate to align the answer of the LLM to the respective group.</p>
            <br>

              <p>Since the OpinionQA dataset provides distributions statistics of the options selected at group level, and the overall statistics; we select the answer with high probablity from the overall group as the answer from the LLM. The correction for each group is the option with high probability from the answer distribution for the respective question. This would let Aligner correct the responses to generate group opinions.</p>

              An example question-answer-correction generated for Democrat and Republican groups is shown below.<br>
              <strong>Question:</strong> How much, if at all, do you think the ease with which people can legally obtain guns contributes to gun violence in the country today?<br>

              <strong>Correction (Democrat):</strong> A great deal<br>
              <strong>Correction (Republican):</strong> Not too much<br>
              <strong>Correction (Independent):</strong> A fair amount<br><br>

            <h4 class="title is-5">DescriptiveOpinionQA</h4>
              <p>To generate better descriptive responses, we leveraged GPT-3.5-Turbo and constructed synthetic answers and corrections for each group. We use the following group level prompts and get a response for each question available in the OpinionQA dataset.</p>
              <pre>group_intepretation_map = {
  "Overall": "Consider yourself as a United States citizen.",
  "Democrat": "Consider yourself as a United States citizen. In today's United States politics, you are Democrat.",
  "Republican": "Consider yourself as a United States citizen. In today's United States politics, you are Republican.",
  "$100,000 or more": "Consider yourself as a United States citizen. Your total family annual income from all sources before taxes is $100,000 or more.",
  "Less than $30,000": "Consider yourself as a United States citizen. Your total family annual income from all sources before taxes is less than $30,000."
}</pre>

              <p>Data generation follows this sequence:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Set the appropriate group context based on the group interpretation map.</li>
                <li>Generate responses using GPT-3.5-Turbo by feeding a question and interpreting the context.</li>
                <li>Store the generated responses for each group to all the questions.</li>

              <strong>Question:</strong> How much, if at all, do you think the ease with which people can legally obtain guns contributes to gun violence in the country today?<br>
              <strong>Answer:</strong> I believe that the ease with which people can legally obtain guns in the United States does contribute to gun violence, and I am concerned about the impact it has on the safety of our communities.<br>
              <strong>Correction (Democrat):</strong> The ease of legally obtaining guns in the United States definitely contributes to the high rates of gun violence we see in our country today, and stricter gun control measures are necessary to address this issue.<br>
              <strong>Correction (Republican):</strong> I believe that the ease of legally obtaining guns should be balanced with ensuring proper background checks and mental health evaluations to prevent gun violence in our country.<br>

              <h3 class="title is-4">Discussion on Chosen Groups</h3>
              <p>We chose specific groups such as income and political orientation based on their disparate nature, as demonstrated in the OpinionsQA data analysis.</p>

              <h3 class="title is-4">Exploring Option Descriptions</h3>
              <p>Despite generating data using available options shown to GPT, results were unsatisfactory. We also attempted to generate answers without specific options, prompting GPT to produce answers based directly on group context or as a generic US citizen.</p>

          We used existing datasets as well as generated our own datasets as a part of this project. 

          Dataset used in GPO is OpinionsQA (Steering) and GlobalOpinionsDataset. It benchamarks group alignment on two recent survey datasets: (1) OpinionQA (Santurkar et al., 2023), which spans 22 US demographic groups (e.g. income, political ideology, race, and sex) across 500 multiple-choice questions and (2) GlobalOpinionQA (Durmus et al., 2023), which contains multiplechoice questions answered by participants from 14 countries, amounting to 2,554 questions which cover various topics including politics, media, technology, religion, race, and ethnicity.

          To compare our method against existing GPO method, we confined to the original dataset and ran our method against this dataset.

          Along with this, we wanted to explore aligning conversations that didn't have options. The above datasets only offered objective responses and thus, we created synthetic data for the same questions available.
          We used GPT-3.5-turbo to generate this desciptive dataset using similar prompts that are used to steer the LLM in OpinionsQA which were also used in GPO.

          To generate dataset to train aligner, we need it in the format of Q-A-C. Where Q is the question, A is the answer generated and C is the correction that the aligner is expected to generate. 
          For generating correction C, we give the interpretation of the group as the context for GPT to generate the answer according to the group. For generating A, we don't give any specific group context, instead,
          we just ask GPT to answer as United States citizen.

          <h2 class="title is-3">Method</h2>
          <p>

            CODEBASEEE - deepspeed, aligner, tech stack etc.,
            Talk a bit more about aligner. Give example. SHow the input, output, training and inference formats. Q, A and C. 
            
            We wanted to explore two ways of group preference alignment.
            First is a single stage training, including all the basic safety plus the group preference data per group. Q, A, C format: (TOODO: train from scratch if possible)            
              a) all safety + single group data
              b) all safty + all group data with different prompts
            Second is a two stage training, where we have all the basic safety pretrained in a aligner and we only use adapter modules per group to induct group specific preferences in that module.
              a) single group 
              b) all group with different prompts at a time (TODO2: different prompts, 2k data, all groups trained at once)
            how llms confuse or have the ability to steer according to the prompt vs keeping it clean and making sure it has only one group knowledge and the trianing is also kind of indepent in a. 
            i.e., you add more groups indepedently, second has overall less paramenter,s but need retraining wehn new group data is added.


            Comparison:
            To compare against GPO method, we also trained Aligner with options data that is used in GPO and 
            Method of GPO:
            1. generate embedding
            2. 

            Ablation:
            We also wanted to explore RLHF methods and compare it against the above SFT methods and GPO.
            DPO:
            Write somehting about DPO. The format is different, we only give prompt here and expect it to generate a corrected output instead of feeding it to a different model for correction like in the case of Aligner

            First single stage training:
              a) 
              b)
            Second is a two stage training: We have pretrained a DPO from scratch using X data as per the aligner paper to have a fair comparision to the aligner pretrained model for this stage.
              a) single group
              b) all groups with different prompts.  -- potential disdavntage, affter training for n groups, direclty training for n+1th gorup might not reuslt sin same result as training for n+1 gorups. so,  first one might be simpler


            observations:
            Unlike in Aligner, DPO needs finetuning of the entire LLM. So, we tried to compare it fairly by dividing the safety dataset into 10 parts and using only that per group.
            to compare it compute wise.
            Also, subjective vs objective comparisons.
          
          </p>
          <h2 class="title is-3">Challenges</h2>
          <p>
          Data generation:
          1. LLM doesn't give output in common format. 
          POSTPROCESS TO GET IN NECESSARY FORMATS FOR TRAINING. LLM OUTPUTS REQUIRE A LOT OF CLEANING TO GET INTO DESIRED FORMAT - LEARNING.
          2. Need to tune the temperature accordingly.
          3. Had to experiemnt with prompt a lot to ensure it doesn't give generic repsonses for all groups and
           it doesn't give garbase or too obvious answers like, "Given I am a democrat, according to my view, ..." etc.,
           It was really tricky to get the correct prompt to generate the data
          4. Low training data per group, thus, can't train models liek Aligner from scratch and have to stick to finetuning.
          5. Incomplete sentences: {
            "key": "LEGALIMG_W41",
            "question": "In order to maintain the strength of the U.S. economy over the next 30 years, do you think that legal immigration will need to be",
            "answer": "Maintained at current levels",
            "correction": "Maintained at current levels"
        },{
          "key": "LOCALELECT_W29",
          "question": "The next question is about local elections, such as for mayor or a school board. Do you",
          "answer": "Always vote in local elections",
          "correction": "Never vote in local elections"
      }

          Huge models. For available gpu.
          1. memory isn't enough to load such large models
          2. deepspped zero stages exploring for tradeoffs between time and memory
          3. max_length generation is going out of memory, had to fix that well
          4. load in low bit resolution (peft) and train in 32 bit
          5. lora was necessary
          6. Multiple codebases, training details for dpo not completely there in aligner etc.,

          Aligner Answers:

          GPO Answers:

          Rouge Scores:


            Highlight 1:
            Plots. 
            When we train with splits across groups, i.e., 80% of groups with all questions are trained and 20% of groups are evaluated, the alignment score is high both with 22 groups and with a subset of 4 groups. When 
            but when we train with split across questions and we train for all groups i.e., 80% of all questions for all groups are trained and 20% are evaluated, the alignment score is low.

            We conjecture that this is due to bias towards questions that have already been seen.

            Insert a nice image with rectangels drawn across the excel sheet to show the split and maybe even numbers aaccordingly.



            Highlight 2: classification vs regression
            We have to highlight that the results are biased towards GPO. This is because, GPO predicts the probability distribution of the options and not the direct text. We evaluate the rouge score between the highest probable option and the ground truth option. Here, the generations are fixed. Thus, the model is not burdened with generating the exact option content like in the case of aligner. 
            Example:
            Q: Women question
            A: No difference
            GT: No difference
            Aligner: It's not directly a realted concern.

            so, as we can see, although both the models are intending the same thing, the score for GPO inherently is setup to give higher score over Aligner model.


            Highlight 3:
            Compared to GPO, in our model, every time a new group is added, we need to train our adapter module. However, The solution mentioned in GPO for long prompts requires running embeddings for all Q and A in the beginning. During the inference time, the context is generated by appending all the embeddings for selected number of Q-As of that group. This will add overhead every time a new group is tested.

          <p>
            GPO parameterizes a novel transformer module which in-context learns to predict group preference scores for new LLM outputs given a few examples of LLM outputs and ground-truth preference scores from that group.

 <h2 class="title is-4">Adapt to Group Preferences</h2>
          <p>
            GPO-aligned LLM outputs exhibit higher alignment scores compared with common baseline methods for multiple popular open-source models across varying parameter and pretraining dataset size scales, and opinion datasets.

          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="static/alignment_results.png" alt="qualitative example for climate question" style="width:100%">
          </figure>

          <p>
<p>
    Qualitatively, we find that GPO-aligned LLM output distributions are significantly more similar to group ground truth distributions than baseline methods.
</p>
<p>
    In the qualitative example below, the first row depicts the ground truth group opinion distribution. With limited context samples, GPO successfully adapts to match the opinion distributions of different groups. 
    For instance, it increases preference for option A when adapted to the group <em>Hindus</em>, whereas other steered LMs do not exhibit correct distribution changes. In particular, 
    <em>Llama2-13b-steered</em> seems biased towards a specific option, overemphasizing it instead of providing an accurate reflection of the targeted group's distribution.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, for demographics like <em>College graduate/some postgrad</em> that have a balanced opinion distribution, GPO preserves this balance effectively. This underlines 
    GPO's ability not just to align with broad dataset group preferences, but also to fine-tune its alignment to specific groups with limited context.

            GPO is also significantly more <b>sample efficient</b> than baseline methods, achieving higher alignment scores while using fewer examples.

 <h2 class="title is-4">Adapt to Individual Preferences</h2>
          <p>
            We also show that GPO is also able to adapt to a single individual’s preferences, a setting where there is often much higher variance between preference datasets than the group preference alignment setting.

          <p>
            GPO provides a framework for few-shot alligning LLMs to group preferences. GPO significantly outperforms prior
            methods as measured by alignment score for group preference alignment while requiring no gradient
            updates to the base LLM. We find that GPO is also more sample efficient, improving alignment score
            significantly more than baseline methods while using fewer samples, and is effective across multiple
            popular open-source LLMs of various parameter and pre-training dataset scales. Future work should explore adapting GPO 
            with other datasets (especially non-mulitiple choice format), the impact of aligning to group preferences on 
            alignment for other values including harmlessness or helpfulness, and using pre-training model initializations for 
            the GPO module
