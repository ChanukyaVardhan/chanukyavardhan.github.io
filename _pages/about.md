<!-- I am interested in the areas of Computer Vision and Deep Learning, specifically working on problems at the intersection of Deep Learning with applications in Computer Vision.
<br><br>
I am currently looking for research opportunities in this space.
<br><br>
I worked at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/worldwide/india/){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru, India from June 2018 to Feb 2022, where I was fortunate to work in two different teams. I was part of Marquee Portfolio Analytics team for an year from Feb 2021 to Feb 2022, where I focused on building portfolio analytical tools on the Marquee platform for hedge fund managers and institutional clients to understand the performance of their portfolios, and mainly worked on developing the [Carbon Analytics Tool](https://marquee.gs.com/welcome/campaigns/carbon-portfolio-analytics){:target="_blank"}. Before that I was part of Market Risk Strats team, and worked on building Risk Models that help capture the Market Risk exposure, mainly looking at Interest Rate and Commodities space. I was also part of the GSRisk initiative developing an enhanced risk engine to converge on unified risk engine across divisions. Before joining full time, I did my Summer Internship in 2017 in the same Market Risk Strats team working on backfilling of timeseries. I also did a couple of internships at [Infurnia](https://www.infurnia.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Tavaga](https://tavaga.com/){:target="_blank"} during my sophomore year.
<br><br>
I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India in 2018. -->
